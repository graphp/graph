## 0.6.0 (2013-xx-xx)

* BC break: Move algorithm definitions in base classes to separate algorithm classes ([#27](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/27)).
The following methods containing algorithms were now moved to separate algorithm classes. This
change encourages code-reuse, simplifies spotting algorithms, helps reducing complexity,
improves testablity and avoids tight coupling. Update your references if applicable:

* BC break: Remove unneeded algorithm alias definitions ([#31](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/31), [#50](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/50)). The following *alias definitions*
have been removed, their original/actual name has already existed before and continues to work
unchanged. Update your references if applicable:

| Old/removed alias definition | Actual name |
|---|---|
| `Graph::isConnected()` | `Algorithm\ConnectedComponents::isSingle()` |
| `Graph::hasEulerianCycle()` | `Algorithm\Eulerian::hasCycle()` |
| `Graph::getNumberOfComponents()` | `Algorithm\ConnectedComponents::getNumberOfComponents()` |

| `Vertex::getVerticesPathTo()` | `Algorithm\ShortestPath\BreadthFirst::getVertices()` |
| `Vertex::getVerticesPathFrom()` | `Algorithm\ShortestPath\BreadthFirst::getVertices()` |

* BC break: Move `Loader\UmlClassDiagram` to separate [fhaculty/graph-uml](https://github.com/fhaculty/graph-uml) repo ([#38](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/38))
* BC break: Remove needless `Algorithm\MinimumSpanningTree\PrimWithIf` (use `Algorithm\MinimumSpanningTree\Prim` instead) ([#45](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/45))
* BC break: `Vertex::createEdgeTo()` now returns an instance of type `Edge\Undirected` instead of `Edge\UndirectedId` ([#46](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/46))
* Feature: New `Algorithm\Tree` namespace with algorithms for undirected and directed, rooted trees ([#44](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/44))
* Feature: According to be above list of moved algorithm methods, the following algorithm classes have been added ([#27](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/27)):
    * New `Algorithm\Weight` ([#33](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/33))
    * New `Algorithm\Degree` ([#29](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/29), [#49](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/49))
    * New `Algorithm\Directed` ([#34](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/34))
    * New `Algorithm\Symmetric` ([#41](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/41))
    * New `Algorithm\Complete` ([#43](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/43))
    * New `Algorithm\Flow` ([#30](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/30), [#47](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/47))
    * New `Algorithm\Tree` ([#44](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/44))
* Feature: `Graph::createVertices()` now also accepts an array of vertex IDs ([#19](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/19))
* Fix: Various issues with `Vertex`/`Edge` layout attributes ([#32](https://github.com/clue/graph/issues/32))
