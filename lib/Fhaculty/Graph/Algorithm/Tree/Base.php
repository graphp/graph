/**
 * Abstract base class for tree algorithms
 *
 * This abstract base class provides the base interface for working with
 * graphs that represent a tree.
 *
 * A tree is a connected Graph (single component) with no cycles. Every Tree is
 * a Graph, but not every Graph is a Tree. A null Graph (a Graph with no Vertices
 * and thus no Edges) is *NOT* considered a valid Tree, as it is not considered
 * connected (@see ConnectedComponents and @link)
 *
 *    A
 *   / \
 *  B   C
 *     / \
 *    D   E
 *
 * Special cases are undirected trees (like the one pictured above), handled via
 * Tree\Undirected and directed, rooted trees (InTree and OutTree), handled via
 * Tree\BaseDirected.
