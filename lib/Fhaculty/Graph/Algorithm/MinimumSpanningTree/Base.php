/**
 * Abstract base class for minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithms
 *
 * A minimum spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects
 * all the vertices together while minimizing the total sum of all edges'
 * weights.
 *
 * A spanning tree thus requires a connected graph (single connected component),
 * otherwise we can span multiple trees (spanning forest) within each component.
 * Because a null graph (a Graph with no vertices) is not considered connected,
 * it also can not contain a spanning tree.
 *
 * Most authors demand that the input graph has to be undirected, whereas this
 * library supports also directed and mixed graphs. The actual direction of the
 * edge will be ignored, only its incident vertices will be checked. This is
 * done in order to be consistent to how ConnectedComponents are checked.
